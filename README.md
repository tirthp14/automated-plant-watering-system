#*Automated Plant Watering System*

##This project involves creating an automated plant watering system using MATLAB and an Arduino Nano. The system monitors soil moisture levels and activates a water pump as needed to maintain optimal soil moisture. This repository contains the MATLAB code required to run the system.

##*Features*

1. Automatic Soil Moisture Monitoring: Continuously monitors the soil moisture level using a soil moisture sensor connected to the Arduino.
2. Automated Water Pump Activation: Turns on the water pump when soil moisture falls below defined thresholds.
3. Real-Time Data Logging and Visualization: Logs soil moisture data and plots real-time soil wetness percentage over time.
4. User-Controlled Start and Stop: The system can be started and stopped using a push button connected to the Arduino.
